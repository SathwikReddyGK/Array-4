# Solution

# // Time Complexity :  O(N)
# // Space Complexity : O(1)
# // Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# // Any problem you faced while coding this : No

# // Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# Start from the right and find the position where the number decreases,
# if the number decreases then that is the point where we can make a change. Swap that
# with the immediate number and then perform reversing of that part of the string.
